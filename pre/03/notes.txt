Think Java 4.11 Ex 1
  1. Output of program: 
    No, I wug.
    You wugga wug.
    I wug.
  2. Stack diagram showing state of program the first time ping is invoked:
    main
    zoop
    baffle
    ping
  3. If baffle() is invoked at the end of the ping method, an infinite loop would be created with baffle and ping calling each other, which would be a problem.
