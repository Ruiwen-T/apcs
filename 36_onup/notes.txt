Kinds of Errors
	- compile-time: something is wrong w/ syntax
	- run-time: something goes wrong while program is running
	- logic: program doesn't do what you think it does
Compile-time Errors:
	- preventative approach: incremental development
	- only the first error message is reliable 
	- read error messages carefully
	- look to where computer points you to, but also broaden search
	- indent properly
	- Common Syntax Errors (what to check for)
		- all parentheses + brackets balanced, properly nested
		- uppercase vs. lowercase
		- semicolons
		- matching quotation marks, String-> "", char-> ''
		- assignment statements
			- can you actually assign a value to expression on left?
			- does the type on the left match the type on the right?
		- invoking a value method: should be doing something w/ result
		- invoking a void method: should not be doing something w/ result
		- invoke instance methods on objects w/ right type
		- invoke static methods outside of clsas where defined by specifying class name + dot notation
		- inside instance method, can refer to instance variables w/o specifying objject but not in static method
	- check if editing the program that the computer is compiling (try putting deliberate syntax error right at beginning to confirm)
	- debugging by bisection 
		- make backup (Bob.java.old)
		- delete about half of code
		- determine which half error is in and repeat
	- error messages not reliable, don't completely follow what they say
Run-time Errors:
	- add print statements (but in organized, controlled, helpful manner!)
	- "hanging" = program stops + seems to be doing nothing (usually infinite loop or recursion)
		- add "entering loop"/"exiting loop" immediately before/after loop
		- StackOverflowError?
		- recomprehend flow of execution: order program actually runs
		- infinite loop: add print at end of loop w/ variable + condition values
		- infinite recursion: check base case + check that program reaches it, add print at beginning of method w/ parameters
		- flow of execution: add print at beginning of each method to display a trace, or display arguments
	- getting an exception
		- we receive: name of exception, line where it occurred, stack trace (method that was running, method that invoked it, ...)
		- NullPointerException
			- which variable is null, and how did it get there?
		- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
			- negative or > array.length-1
			- print array size, index
		- StackOverflowError
		- FileNotFoundException
			- make sure file exists and path is correct
		- Arithmetic Exception
			- something went wrong during arithmetic operation (ex: x/0)
	- scale down problem program is working on
	- clean up + reorganize
Logic Errors:
	- is there something the program was supposed to do that isn't/doesn't seem to be happening?
	- is something happening that shouldn't?
	- unexpected effect?
	- break program into independent components to find discrepancies btw mental model + reality
	- break complex expression into series of assignments to temporary variables
	- change print to println if print statement not doing anything
	- take time away
	- talk to human/rubber ducky
	- Common Logic Errors (what to check for)
		- integer division truncates (use integers for countable things and floating points for measurable things)
		- if Math.abs(d-1.23) < 0.0000001 instead of if(d == 1.23)
		- == vs .equals
		- inheritance
