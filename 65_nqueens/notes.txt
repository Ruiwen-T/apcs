time spent: 0.5 hrs

- Backtracking as discussed in class,
  goes through all the possibilities, going back a step and
  eliminating that possibility from the "tree". We continue with this process
  until we eventually find a solution for the desired board dimensions.
- removeQueen() and addQueen are both necessary to experiment with the different possibilities at each square.
- We would like to start in the first column, first row and move to higher columns and rows.
