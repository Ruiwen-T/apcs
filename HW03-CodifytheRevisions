0. The "base" in a "base-X number system" determines what digits are used in the system (ex: base-10 uses digits 0 to 9, and base-2 uses digits 0 and 1). 
  In particular, powers of X correspond to place values. 
  For example, base-10's place values are ..., 10^3, 10^2, 10^1, 10^0. Similarly, base-2's place values are ..., 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0.
  
1. Binary is a numerical system in base 2. In binary, 1 indicates on or true, and 0 indicates off or false. 
   We care because binary is often used by computers to store information.
